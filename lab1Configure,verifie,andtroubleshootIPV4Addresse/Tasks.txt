Lab : Configure , verifie , and troubleshoot IPV4 addresse 

Lab Objective:
The objective of this lab exercise is for you to learn and understand
how to create and troubleshoot IPv4 addresses on Cisco routers.

Lab Purpose:
Configuring IPv4 addressing is one of your most fundamental tasks
as a Cisco engineer. In the exam, you may also be asked to
troubleshoot IPv4 addressing that has already been configured but
incorrectly, so you need to know which show commands to use.

Task 1:
Configure the hostnames on routers R1 and R3 as illustrated in the
topology.
Task 2:
Configure R1 S0/0, which is a DCE, to provide a clock rate of 768
Kbps to R3 (unless you are using GNS3). Configure the IP addresses 
on the Serial interfaces of R1 and R3 as illustrated in the
topology. Configure the Loopback interfaces specified in the diagram
on R1 and R3.
Task 3:
Use the correct show commands to check:
1. The summary of all configured IP addresses;
2. The status of the interface (up/down or administratively down);
and
3. The subnet mask applied to the interface.
