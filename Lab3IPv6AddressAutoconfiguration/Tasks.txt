Lab . IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration

Lab Objective:
The objective of this lab exercise is for you to learn and understand
how to configure IPv6 addresses on Cisco routers using address
autoconfiguration and EUI-64 addressing.

Lab Purpose:
Configuring IPv6 addressing is one of your most fundamental tasks
as a Cisco engineer. In the exam, you may also be asked to
configure an IPv6 address using Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration (SLACC) as well as EUI-64 addressing.

Task 1:
Configure the hostnames on routers R1 and R3 as illustrated in the
topology
Task 2:Configure the IP addresses on the Ethernet interfaces of R1 and R3
as illustrated in the topology. Configure the Loopback interfaces
specified in the diagram on R3.
F0/0 on R3 will use SLACC to obtain the address prefix from R1.
Loopback0 will use EUI-64 to complete the host portion of the
address.
Task 3
Use the correct show commands to check:
1. The summary of all configured IP addresses;
2. The status of the interface (up/down or administratively down);
and
3. The subnet mask applied to the interface.
