Lab 2. Configure, Verify, and Troubleshoot IPv6 Addresses

Lab Objective:
The objective of this lab exercise is for you to learn and understand
how to create and troubleshoot IPv6 addresses on Cisco routers.

Lab Purpose:
Configuring IPv6 addressing is one of your most fundamental tasks
as a Cisco engineer. In the exam, you may also be asked to
troubleshoot IPv6 addressing that has been incorrectly configured,
so you need to know which show commands to use.

Task 1:
Configure the hostnames on routers R1 and R3 as illustrated in the
topology.
Task 2:
Configure R1 S0/0, which is a DCE, to provide a clock rate of 768
Kbps to R3 (unless you are using GNS3). Configure the IP
addresses on the Serial interfaces of R1 and R3 as illustrated in the
topology. Configure the Loopback interfaces specified in the diagram
on R1 and R3.
Task 3:
Use the correct show commands to check:
1. The summary of all configured IPv6 addresses (note the need
to specify IPv6 in the show commands);
2. The status of the interface (up/down or administratively down);
and
3. The subnet mask applied to the interface.
